# calculator

This is my calculator submission for the final foundations project for TOP.

Like the previous Etch-a-sketch, this project makes use of all the material learned thus far.

Being the final project I put in a lot more effort than my past work to make my calculator look pretty. 
Difficulties arose when getting the calculator to function correctly but the obstacles were mainly 
my ability to comprehend the logic behind a calculator when a button is pressed.
